# <cj>GDNeko</c>
This mod brings the ancient desktop cat into a few <cg>Geometry Dash</c> menus!

<cb>The textures of Neko have been updated. If you want its classic look, get the texture pack in the "Releases" tab on the GitHub repo! (Get the Happy Textures pack if you intend on making your own sprites, it makes the process a lot easier)</c>

<cy>Thank you </c>E<cr>V</c>W<cy> for showcasing this mod!</c>

<c-aaaaaa>(If you're a mod developer, you can add Neko to your menus without having every user installing this mod! ![easy face](frame:diffIcon_01_btn_001.png?scale=0.3))</c>
