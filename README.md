# <cj>GDNeko</c>
This [Geode](https://geode-sdk.org) mod brings the ancient desktop cat into <cg>Geometry Dash</c>'s main menu!

<cb>The textures of Neko have been updated. If you want its classic look, get a texture pack.</c>

(If you're a mod developer, you can add Neko to your menus without making this mod a dependency!)
